# Final-Project
Presentation on: May 12th, 2016.

# Synopsis:
This program was designed for Connecticut College’s Computer Science 212: Data Structures. 
The ultimate goal of the program is to create a database of movies that registered users could manipulate in their wish lists, 
adding in different orders, deleting and ‘watching’.  When running the program, users can either login as 
‘administrators’ who can edit the entire movie database, ‘customers’ who can edit their own personal wishlist (up to twenty movies) 
but also view all movies from the main database, or ‘new customers’ who can register in the customer database with their name, email, 
credit card number, and create a password to login in the future. 

# Test:
Test this code by running the main function, NetFlix.java. 
This file calls on MainMenu.java which depending on user input accesses the other data structures in the file.
